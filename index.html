    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hello, there! My name is Boluwatife. I am an undergraduate at the University of Lagos studying Engineering. For as long as I can remember, I have been fascinated by Tech, how it solves problems and how it makes the lives of others easier. My hobbies include playing FIFA, watching a Steph Curry masterclass, learning Spanish and learning new things. My goal is to learn, grow and become more knowledgeable and better in the Frontend Engineering Field and ultimately land a job.</p>
